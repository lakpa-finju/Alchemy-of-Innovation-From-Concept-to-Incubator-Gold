    "title": "Getting Started with React",
    "content": "React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.\n\nHere are some key features of React:\n\n1. **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components, which are reusable, self-contained pieces of code.\n\n2. **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance, making it efficient for complex UIs.\n\n3. **Declarative Syntax**: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript.\n\n4. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data in React flows in one direction, making your application more predictable and easier to debug.\n\nTo get started with React, you first need to install Node.js and npm. Then you can create a new React application using Create React App:\n\n```\nnpx create-react-app my-app\ncd my-app\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will set up a new React project with all the necessary configurations and start a development server.",
